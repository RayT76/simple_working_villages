[debugging]

#    Enables the debug tools for working villages.
#    They can be obtained ingame through the creative inventory.
#    They affect the nearby nodes in some way that helps to see if working villages is working properly.
simple_working_villages_enable_debug_tools (debug tools) bool false

#    Enables some extra asserts in the code that ensure everything runs as expected.
#    This may have a small effect on the performance.
#    It helps finding bugs within working villages and within mods using working villages.
simple_working_villages_enable_debug_checks (debug checks) bool false

[protection]
#    Controls activity in protected areas.
#    false: Activity is not allowed in protected areas.
#    true: Activity is allowed in protected areas if the owner would be allowed.
#    ignore: Activity is allowed in protected areas.
#    prefix: Protection is tested using a fake player name of "[prefix]:[owner]"
#            For example, if the owner is "user1" and the prefix is "owner"
#            the test will use the player name "owner:user1". This is
#            useful with protection mods that allow protection to be
#            configured using arbitrary player names.
simple_working_villages_owner_protection (owner protection) string false
